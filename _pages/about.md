I am a computer science student at university of Tehran. I have always been fascinated by computers and robots, and I'm passionate about the evolving field of machine learning and neuroscience.

I excelled during high school and gained admission to the University of Tehran's computer science program. Here, I honed my programming, neuroscience, algorithm design, computer vision, machine learning and data science skills. I also balanced my studies with sports and music, developing teamwork and independence.

As a neuroscience research assistant at [CNRL](https://cnrl.ut.ac.ir/) (Computational Neuroscience Research Laboratory), I am actively engaged in
cutting-edge, technology-driven research within the field and I work on vision tasks using spiking neural networks. Additionally, my role as a teaching assistant has equipped me with the professionalism needed to collaborate effectively with both professors and fellow students.

To gain real-world experience, I joined [Jetco](https://en.jetco.co/) as a computer vision Developer. In the Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS) team, I worked on real-time depth estimation, 3D reconstruction, and object detection for self-driving cars. This experience taught me valuable skills in research, AI model development, teamwork, and communication.
