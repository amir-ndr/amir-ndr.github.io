                <h1>Semi-Asynchronous Federated Learning via Over-the-Air Aggregation</h1>
                <!-- <p><em>Supervisor: <a href="https://science.ut.ac.ir/en/~mgtabesh">Prof. Mohammad GanjTabesh</a></em></p> -->
                <p>
                    This project investigates energy-constrained federated
                    learning (FL) in wireless networks, where heterogeneous
                    clients collaborate over bandwidth-limited and delay-prone channels.
                    We propose SAOTA, a novel semi-asynchronous FL framework
                    that integrates over-the-air (OTA) analog aggregation with
                    adaptive client selection to reduce communication latency and
                    mitigate the impact of stragglers and stale updates. Unlike prior
                    synchronous or fully asynchronous schemes, SAOTA jointly minimizes
                    the convergence error, energy consumption, and training
                    time under the semi-asynchronous OTA-based framework. To this
                    end, we formulate a constrained optimization problem and apply
                    Lyapunov optimization to develop a drift-plus-penalty-based algorithm
                    to balance convergence performance and resource usage
                    through adaptive client selection and closed-form transmit power
                    allocation. We also provide theoretical guarantees on convergence
                    and constraint satisfaction. Extensive experiments under realistic
                    network conditions demonstrate that SAOTA outperforms stateof-
                    the-art baselines in both learning performance and resource
                    efficiency.

            <p><em>Supervisor: <a href="https://science.ut.ac.ir/en/~mgtabesh">Prof. Mohammad GanjTabesh</a></em></p>

                This repository presents the final project for the Computational Neuroscience course at the University of Tehran,
                Department of Computer Science under the supervision of M. Ganjtabesh. The project focuses on feature extraction and image classification from grayscale images using convolution and
                max-pooling layers within a spiking neural network (SNN). In this project, we aim to extract meaningful features from images utilizing convolution and max-pooling techniques. The neural network model employed consists of three layers with convolutional connections between the first and second layers,
                followed by pooling connections between the second and third layers. Also The learning rule used here is STDP and RSTDP.

            <h1>Self-supervised Monocular Depth Estimation</h1>
            <p>
                Monocular depth estimation, also known as single-image depth estimation or depth prediction from a single image, is a computer vision task that involves estimating the
                depth or distance information of objects in a scene from a single 2D image or photograph. This project uses an encoder-decoder model to estimate the depth of a single image based on photometric
                errors. Moreover, we employed various backbone architectures, including ResNet18, STDCNet, and DarkNet, and
                conducted an analysis on each of them. The model is an unsupervised model consisting of two networks, one for estimating depth and the other for estimating pose.

            <h1>TRPO vs PPO: Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Comparison</h1>
            <!-- <p><em>Supervisor: <a href="https://science.ut.ac.ir/en/~mgtabesh">Prof. Mohammad GanjTabesh</a></em></p> -->
            <p>
                Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms such as Trust Region
                Policy Optimization (TRPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization
                (PPO) are designed to achieve stable and efficient
                policy training. This project implements both algorithms
                from scratch and evaluates their performance in
                the Atari Breakout-v5 environment from the Gymnasium
                suite. We compare TRPO and PPO based on sample
                efficiency, training stability, and computational cost.
                While environment interaction relies on existing libraries,
                all core learning components are independently developed.
                Our controlled experiments aim to characterize the tradeoffs
                between these two policy optimization methods. We
                find that, despite TRPOâ€™s mathematical guarantees, PPO
                outperforms TRPO in all metrics.

            <h1>Breast Cancer Classification</h1>
            <p>
                Breast cancer is a common form of cancer, and early detection is crucial. This project tackles
                the task of identifying cancerous regions in breast tissue images, which is a crucial step in cancer diagnosis. 
                The dataset consists of breast tissue images, categorized into healthy and cancerous classes.
                The images are preprocessed and organized for training and evaluation.
                The dataset contains two classes: healthy and cancerous. It's balanced and suitable for training a machine learning model.
                A CNN architecture is designed to classify breast tissue images. It includes convolutional layers, batch normalization, dropout, and fully connected layers.
                This Python project aims to classify breast cancer images into two categories: healthy and cancerous.
                It utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to make predictions based on image patches.

            <h1>Movie Recommendation System</h1>
            <p>
                This project implements a movie recommendation system using both Content-Based and Collaborative Filtering techniques in Python with the Pandas library.
                Content-Based filtering recommends movies to users based on the attributes or features of the movies they have previously rated. In this approach, the system explores users' preferences and recommends movies with similar content features.
                Collaborative Filtering recommends movies by finding patterns in user behavior and preferences. It identifies users with similar tastes and suggests movies liked by those similar users.
