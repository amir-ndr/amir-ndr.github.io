I was a computer science student at university of Tehran, and now I am <strong>MASc student in Elecreical and Computer Engineering at Queen's University.</strong> I have always been fascinated by computers and robots, and I'm passionate about the evolving field of machine learning and neuroscience. <strong>Right now, I am working on federated learning over wireless network.</strong>

As a <strong>neuroscience research assistant</strong> at [CNRL](https://cnrl.ut.ac.ir/) (Computational Neuroscience Research Laboratory), I am actively engaged in
cutting-edge, technology-driven research within the field and I work on vision tasks using spiking neural networks. Additionally, my role as a teaching assistant has equipped me with the professionalism needed to collaborate effectively with both professors and fellow students.

To gain real-world experience, I joined [Jetco](https://en.jetco.co/) as a <strong>computer vision Developer</strong>. In the Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS) team, I worked on real-time depth estimation, 3D reconstruction, and object detection for self-driving cars. This experience taught me valuable skills in research, AI model development, teamwork, and communication.
